# Forager ZMK Config

Firmware for [Forager](https://github.com/carrefinho/forager) keyboard (using official ZMK [config with dongle](https://github.com/carrefinho/forager-zmk-module-dongle)).

Two dongle types configured :

* [Prospector](https://github.com/carrefinho/prospector) Dongle + [YADS](https://github.com/janpfischer/zmk-dongle-screen) Screen
* Generic XIAO BLE and [RgbLed Adapter](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget) for notifications and layer status.

Also left and right halves have two versions of the firmware file, one with rgbled enable and one without. When using the prospector I almost never pay attention to the rgbled in the xiao, so I condigured a rgbled-less firmware as well.
